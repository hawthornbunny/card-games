# Thirty-One (London Pony Meet variant)
Traditional card game, with some inspiration from the Worcester variant of [Chase the Ace](http://louderyay.blogspot.com/2018/05/chase-ace-worcester-style.html). Originally sourced from Kevan Davis' [Freeze-Dried Games Pack](https://kevan.org/fdgp/).

## Requirements
* One 52-card deck of standard playing cards, ideally MLP-themed
* 2 or more players

## Rules
* Each player starts with 3 lives. Players may use physical objects to represent their lives.
* The dealer starts the round by dealing 3 cards to each player face-down, and 3 cards face-up in the center. The cards in the center are called the _board_.
* Players take turns, starting with the player on the dealer's left. On their turn, a player may do one of the following:
  * **Swap:** Exchange one card from their hand with one card on the board.
  * **Pass:** Do nothing.
  * **Knock:** If a player knocks, the other players get one more turn each, then the round ends. (Knocking after someone has already knocked is considered a pass).
* At the end of the round, each player scores their hand by picking a suit and adding together the value of all cards with that suit. For example, if a player is holding 5♥ 4♥ 2♣, they may add up the two heart values to get a score of 9 points.
* Alternatively, if a player has all three cards of the same rank in different suits, they have a *three-of-a-kind*: this is worth 30-and-a-half points.
* The player with the lowest score loses a life. If multiple players are tied for lowest, they all lose a life.
* If a player loses all lives, they are eliminated from the game.
* The next player becomes the dealer for the next round. Rounds continue until one player remains. That player wins the game.

## Scoring
* **Ace:** 11 points
* **King:** 10 points
* **Queen:** 10 points
* **Jack:** 10 points
* **All other cards**: Face value

## Notes
* The highest possible score is 31 (an Ace worth 11, and two other cards of the same suit worth 10 each).
* Three-of-a-kind is worth 30.5, and is the second-highest possible score (only 31 can beat it).
* I originally developed this variant when trying to find a card game that could be played at the London Pony Meet. I wanted something with features of the Chase the Ace game played at Worcester meets, without being exactly the same, and Thirty-One came pretty close (simple rules, small hands, three-life system, last person standing). I like that it's slightly more strategic, while still being luck-based enough for dramatic upsets.
